# SleakCover

##### **SleakCover is a single-paged website cover with the idea of simplicity in mind.**

### Introduction

------------

This is my very first take at a completely custom website cover and site theme using HTML & CSS primarily. This is also my very first time attempting to seriously learn web development. I have a few goals in mind that I hope to achieve by the end of this. This is a website best used by any type of artist who wants to showcase their work.

### Goals

------------
- Functional, scrolling navigation bar. 
  -[4-24-18: It scrolls with the page. Just need to implement the different pages.]
  -[4-25-18: Transparent background.
- Cover 'button' functionality.
- Custom page transitions using Animate.css.
- Functioning media gallery.
- Functioning contact page.
